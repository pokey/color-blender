# Color blender

Modification of [Color
blender](https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/color-blend/#:::hex) to enable bending
one color away from another. Kinda broken but works well enough for some quick
hacking.

# Usage

1. Set color 1 to the color you want to bend away from
2. Set color 2 to the color you want to bend
3. Set number of steps to 10
4. The color to bend will be in the middle and the colors you want will be below it
